# For a sample banking system in Python using classes and functions, here are some possible features you might consider implementing:
#
# ### Core Features
#
# 1. **Account Management**:
#    - Create an account (e.g., `create_account` function).
#    - View account details (e.g., `view_account` function).
#    - Close an account (e.g., `close_account` function).
#
# 2. **Transaction Management**:
#    - Deposit funds (e.g., `deposit` function).
#    - Withdraw funds (e.g., `withdraw` function).
#    - Transfer funds between accounts (e.g., `transfer` function).
#
# 3. **Balance Inquiry**:
#    - Check account balance (e.g., `check_balance` function).
#
# 4. **Authentication**:
#    - User login/logout functionality.
#    - Validate user credentials before performing transactions.
#
# ### Additional Features
#
# 1. **Account Types**:
#    - Saving accounts with interest calculations.
#    - Checking accounts with overdraft facilities.
#
# 2. **Transaction History**:
#    - Record all transactions for an account (e.g., `transaction_history` method).
#
# 3. **Interest Calculation**:
#    - Calculate interest on savings accounts periodically.
#
# 4. **User Interface**:
#    - Command-line interface for user interactions.
#    - Menu-driven options for easy navigation.
#
# 5. **Error Handling**:
#    - Handle insufficient funds for withdrawals.
#    - Handle invalid account operations.
#
# 6. **Admin Features** (Optional):
#    - View all accounts and their balances.
#    - Generate reports on banking activities.
#
# 7. **Data Persistence**:
#    - Save account details and transaction history to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) for persistence.
#    - Load data from the file when the system starts.
#
# ### Example Class Structure
